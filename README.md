# SynapseML — From Data to Deployment

**SynapseML** is an end-to-end **AutoML system** that automates the complete machine learning lifecycle — from data ingestion to model training, evaluation, selection, and deployment readiness.  
The project is built with **modularity, scalability, and real-world use** in mind.
